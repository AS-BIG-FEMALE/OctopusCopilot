This directory holds tests that function as experiments. Unlike unit tests,
it is expected that some of these tests fail to demonstrate scenarios that
push the boundaries of the LLM or are hard to verify in an automated fashion.
The files in this directory do not end with the suffix "_test" so they wre not
run automatically by the CI/CD pipelines.
